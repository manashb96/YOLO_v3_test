# YOLO_v3_test

This is a test YOLO file using opencv and weights and cfg file downloaded from the official 'darkflow' website https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/  

We also made use of the 80 labels from the coco dataset.  
We made use of opencv library to make use of the webcam and then created a YOLO model using the function available in opencv.

We got very less fps and I didnt know how to make use of the GPU to increase the fps.
